- 👋 Hi, I'm @ cjsaavedra76

- 👀 I'm interested... in the world of DIY, I've always been very restless with these things and I'm always messing around, taking from one side and the other.... In the end you learn everything and you don't know anything, but you do the stuff.

- 🌱 I'm currently learning... Python, I've been trying to learn something for three years and it seems that I'm already getting it... Some SQL and above all entertaining myself with the Raspberry Pi... . Now hitting me with the Raspberry Pi PICO

- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on... I don't have enough knowledge to collaborate, but if I can help with something... here I am

- 📫 How to contact me... you can communicate at *bienhecho.bienparece [a] gmail com*

And I'm sorry for my English... it's horrible and I have to use Google Translate
